      <Typography variant='h2'>I'm a Software Developer working remotely from Nigeria.</Typography>
      <Typography variant='body1'>
        I've spent the last few months collaborating and working on various projects ranging from landing pages to web applications, backend APIs, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to work on exciting projects.

      <Typography variant='body1'>
        These days, I'm focused on building accessible, human-centered products, collaborating on open-source projects, and helping startups build better products.

        Before transitioning into software development, I had degrees in Computer Networking from the University of Bedfordshire, UK. I worked as a security surveillance engineer, where I led and trained teams of engineers in building and managing enterprise-level security systems. The type of work was definitely different from development. Still, there are some transferable skills I now use every day as a developer: problem-solving, effective communication, multi-tasking, and more.

        My love for coding and building web applications led me to participate in the Major League Hacking hackathon with Devpost, where I collaborated with a remote team to build a browser tab management app that was highlighted as one of the best projects during the hackathon.

      <Typography variant='body1'>
        When I'm not coding, you'll find me either reading, listening to music, exploring the world with my partner or watching a TV series, and I'm always up for a good conversation.
